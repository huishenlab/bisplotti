Title: Plotting package for bisulfite sequencing data
Description: Bisplotti is primarily a plotting focused package for bisulfite and 
		  bisulfite-like (e.g. EM-seq) sequencing and array data. The main goal
		  is to provide commonly used plotting and directed analyses for these
		  data types and will be evolving over time. If there are specific types
		  of plots that you, as a user, would like to see or have functions to 
		  generate the plots you use on a regular basis, please consider opening
		  either a pull request or an issue.
